# sqlite3 : Working with databases
SQLite3 is a compact free database you can use easily create and use a database. Though SQLite3 is not a full-featured database, it supports a surprisingly large set of the SQL standard, and is ideal for those just starting to learn SQL as well for developers that need a simple database engine to plug into their applications.
In this repository we explore the Sqlite3 program by creating databases, adding tables, reading csv files into those tables and querying the creaated databases.

* [**Introduction**](https://github.com/Alexelofu/sqlite/tree/main/SQLITE1) 
Here we explore the different data types present in the language, create a database using visual studio code, create a table, add values and lastly query the created database for inputted data.

* [**Reading CSV**](https://github.com/Alexelofu/sqlite/tree/main/SqliteTest)
Here we work with the given car_price csv file, obtaining a train test csv from knowledge of supervised learning. We then create a database and table, before reading the csv file into the table and then querying the database using different techniques.
